# DeepMPRA

We present DeepMPRA, the first example of an \textit{in silico} regulatory activity predictor trained on massively parallel reporter assays (MRPA). DeepMPRA is implemented using a multitask, deep convolutional neural network architecture trained to predict MRPA output from DNA sequence. The trained model can be used to predict regulatory activity along the genome and to quantify the importance of regulatory elements for gene expression.
